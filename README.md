## 1Ô∏è‚É£ - WPEngine Site

Start off with the correct setup in WP engine website hosting account.

Guidelines on how to name environments and WordPress users is available here in [Glide Nomenclature](https://github.com/) document.

> ‚úîÔ∏è Make sure to follow the nomenclature to ensure same naming scheme across all projects and environments.

<br>

Following is the list of tasks to be performed on WP Engine.


-  Add wp engine website `production environment`

-  Add its `staging environment`

-  Add its `development environment`

-  Add one sftp user to each of these environments

-  Open wordpress admin of `development environment`

-  Update site title and tagline with project name

-  Add admin user for Glide's use

-  Add admin user for Client's use

-  Copy `development environment` to both `staging` and `production environments`

<br>

**From this point onwards developers need to work in development environment only.**

> ‚úîÔ∏è Information on purpose of each environment and how to use it, is in [WP Engine Environments](https://github.com/) document.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ - Local WP Site

Use [Local WP](https://github.com/) for setting up local WordPress environment.

Local WP is supported by WP Engine and it fully integrates with their service.

<br>

- Open Local WP

- Connect Local WP with WP Engine Account

- Pull `development environment` of your project into Local WP

<br>

If for any reason you can not pull the `development environment`, add a new site to Local WP.

> ‚úîÔ∏è Make sure to follow the [Glide Nomenclature](https://github.com/) for Local WP.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ - Local Repository

Use [Github Desktop](https://github.com/) for easy GUI based git workflow.

<br>

- Open Local WP project folder and convert it into a local repository

- Add `.gitignore` file

- Add base theme to WordPress themes folder

<br>

> ‚úîÔ∏èUse latest version of [Glide Base Theme](https://github.com/) from Github

<br>
<br>

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ - Github Repository

Use [Glide Design](https://github.com/) github account and user for setting up remote repository.

<br>

- Create repository in Github

- Connect local and Github repositories

- Add action in Github for continuous deployment

- Connect WP Engine development environment and Github

- Update base theme with project name

- Stage, commit and push the first change in `master branch`

<br>

> ‚úîÔ∏è Make sure to follow the [Glide Nomenclature](https://github.com/) for Github repository.

<br>

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ - Github Branches

Documentation on how Glide Design uses various branch types for different purposes is here in [Github Branches](https://github.com/) document.

<br>

- Create `development branch` from `master branch`

- Create `developer branches` from `development branch`

<br>

**From this point onwards multiple developers can work on the same project at same time.**

> ‚úîÔ∏è Make sure to follow the [Glide Nomenclature](https://github.com/) for Github branches.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ - Support

Months have passed and client came to Glide support to get some changes made on his website.

Follow the steps below to start working on support tickets.

<br>

- Copy `production environment` to `staging environment`

- Copy `staging environment` to `development environment`

- You can skip the previous step if client has not made any file changes.

- Create `developer branch` from `development branch`

- Pull latest version of database to Local WP (if required)

- Pull latest version of uploads folder to Local WP (if required)

- Make the required updates and fixes from support tickets

- Create pull request for lead developer when you are done with edits

- Lead developer reviews the code 

- Merge `developer branch` back into `development branch`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ - Support Release v2.0.1

When ready to share the updates with client, follow these steps.

<br>

- Create `release branch` from `development branch`

- Update version number in theme files and test code

- Merge `release branch` into `master branch`

- Automatic deployment pushes code to development environment on wp engine

- Tag `master branch` with new version number `v2.0.1`

- Merge `release branch` back into `development branch`

- Review `development environment`

- Copy `development environment` to `staging environment` (files only)

- Do content and image edits on `staging environment` (if required)

- Share `staging environment` with client

- On approval copy `staging environment` down to `development environment`

- Copy approved `staging environment` to `production environment` (files only)

- Do content and image edits on `staging environment` (if required)

- Review `production environment` and update client.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Noticed? we made content changes twice, Following are the reasons

If client has made any content changes on production website while you were working on support tickets. When you copy over `staging environment` to `production environment`. You will override his changes. 

And in another scenario if you have not copied `production environment` completely to `staging environment` prior to working on support tickets, You will end up copying over older version of database to `production environment`.

Always follow the simple rule explained here in [WP Engine Environments](https://github.com/) document

üî∫ Code moves up

üîª Data moves down

**A little bit of extra effort saves the headache.**

üî¥üî¥üî¥
Its critical that all developers on all teams follow this workflow to ensure proper version control along with effective collaboration on code.

<br>

Happy Coding!
